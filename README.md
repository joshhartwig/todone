# Todone

![example image]()
This project started as the base app that is built when you go through the fantastic 'Introduction to Next 14' course by Scott Hendrix. The course has you build a really barebones todo app. I wanted to continue to bolt on features and functionaltiy as well as learn some more advanced features that were not part of the course.

## Getting Started

Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app. The app will initialize an empty sqlite database. 

## Dependencies

I used the following tools, packages, etc.. to build this app

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The core framework
- [Typescript](https://typescript.org) - The language
- [Prisma](https://nextjs.org/learn) - ORM and database tooling
- [Shadcn UI](https://nextjs.org/learn) - Amazing lightweight UI components
- [Zod](https://nextjs.org/learn) - Data validation and much more
