This project started as the base app that is built when you go through the fantastic 'Introduction to Next 14' course by Scott Hendrix. The course has you build a really barebones todo app. I wanted to continue to bolt on features and functionaltiy as well as learn some more advanced features that were not part of the course.

## Getting Started

Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app. The app will initialize an empty sqlite database. 


## Dependencies

I used the following tools, packages, etc.. to build this app

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The core framework
- [Prisma](https://nextjs.org/learn) - ORM and database tooling
- [Shadcn UI](https://nextjs.org/learn) - UI components 
- [Zod ](https://nextjs.org/learn) - Data validation and much more

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
